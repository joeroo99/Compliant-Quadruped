This is my journal of the design and building process of **Compliant Quadruped**.

## 10/11/2025 - Brainstorming for the compliant quadruped  

## The idea

Recently, I have become interested in compliant mechanisms, so I want to attempt the creation of a fully compliant quadruped. I have had this idea for a while, but I have not begun the design of it until now. The design will use rolling contact bearings for the joints, coiled nylon actuators for movement (the cheapest usable artificial muscle I can find), and springs to simplify the design.

## Joints and bearings

For this design, I will use rolling contact joints for the bearings. This will make the design lighter, cheaper, and completely compliant (the goal of the project). It will only have two joints per leg for simplicity’s sake. This will mean it won’t have complete freedom, but it will be able to walk. The base of the leg will probably just have a TPU (or other flexible material) cap for friction on the ground. I can structure the joint so that it has a defined range of motion for better control. I found out about this type of joint by watching [the video by Breaking Taps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQiLLcumqDw).

In order for this to be actually usable, I will have to put in some sort of encoder. I think the easiest way to do this would be to utilize an absolute magnetic encoder.

Additionally, to make the project simpler, I will be using a sprawling-type quadruped. This will make it easier to code, due to its low center of balance.

## Actuation

For the movement of the quadruped, I will use coiled nylon actuators; it is the cheapest artificial muscle I can find that would work in this situation. I may also try an ultra-coiled nylon actuator as described [in a paper I found](https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/research.0642), but I would need to conduct some experimentation on what gauge and type of this actuator would be needed. To help with this, I will try to allow some flexibility in where the actuators will be placed, so I can trade out the artificial muscles and experiment.

To cut down on the complexity of this project by 50% (at least when it comes to the electrical wiring), I will only use one actuator per joint. The artificial muscle will be supplemented by a spring that will contract when the muscle relaxes.

## Sketches

Below are some simple sketches I have created for this project. They are absolutely NOT to scale; they are simply for early visualization.
