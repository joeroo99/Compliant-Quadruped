## 10/11/2025 - Brainstorming for the compliant quadruped  

## The idea

Recently, I have become interested in compliant mechanisms, so I want to attempt the creation of a fully compliant quadruped. I have had this idea for a while, but I have not begun the design of it until now. The design will use rolling contact bearings for the joints, coiled nylon actuators for movement (the cheapest usable artificial muscle I can find), and springs to simplify the design.

## Joints and bearings

For this design, I will use rolling contact joints for the bearings. This will make the design lighter, cheaper, and completely compliant (the goal of the project). It will only have two joints per leg for simplicity’s sake. This will mean it won’t have complete freedom, but it will be able to walk. The base of the leg will probably just have a TPU (or other flexible material) cap for friction on the ground. I can structure the joint so that it has a defined range of motion for better control. I found out about this type of joint by watching [the video by Breaking Taps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQiLLcumqDw).

In order for this to be actually usable, I will have to put in some sort of encoder. I think the easiest way to do this would be to utilize an absolute magnetic encoder.

Additionally, to make the project simpler, I will be using a sprawling-type quadruped. This will make it easier to code, due to its low center of balance.

## Actuation

For the movement of the quadruped, I will use coiled nylon actuators; it is the cheapest artificial muscle I can find that would work in this situation. I may also try an ultra-coiled nylon actuator as described [in a paper I found](https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/research.0642), but I would need to conduct some experimentation on what gauge and type of this actuator would be needed. To help with this, I will try to allow some flexibility in where the actuators will be placed, so I can trade out the artificial muscles and experiment.

To cut down on the complexity of this project by 50% (at least when it comes to the electrical wiring), I will only use one actuator per joint. The artificial muscle will be supplemented by a spring that will contract when the muscle relaxes.

## Sketches

Below are some simple sketches I have created for this project. They are absolutely NOT to scale; they are simply for early visualization.

## 10/18/2025 - Designing the Base  

It has taken frustratingly long to create the base of the quadruped using CAD. This was mostly my own fault for overlooking printability; it took way too long.

I started by trying to create a "simple" base that would be similar to the one in my preliminary sketches. In this first attempt, I tried to fit everything into one piece for the base. By the time I was getting close to completing it, however, I realized I had made a fundamental mistake: I forgot to consider printability.

There were impossible overhangs in each of the rolling contact joints built into the base, which needed to be removed. After much thought, I finally, grudgingly, decided to print the joints separately as an insert. I wanted to avoid this because it would add complexity to the design; I would have to design a lid to contain everything, including the electronics. My original plan was just to strap everything willy-nilly on the base, but I won't be able to do that now.

My first attempt at a multi-piece base was to have the hip joint inserts designed to be printed flat on their contact surface. I planned to have this contact side flat, while the other side of the joint (on the leg) would have a curved contact surface. This, though, fell through as well. I forgot I had to allow for the cord (or tendon) to go between the two joints in a figure eight pattern. In this design, it would be hard to accommodate this.

Cue my second attempt at a multi-piece base. This was REALLY close, but I wasn't happy with the geometry the tendons would face in the through holes.

Thus, I created my final attempt. I built off of my last attempt, but decided to optimize it to be printed on a forty-five-degree angle on a chamfer. This will allow for less support material; the only thing I may need is a removable rib to reduce vibration when printing. This, I believe, is the most optimized design I can create at the time being. The one downfall of this design is the stepping that is apparent at this angle, but the bearing won't need to bear that much load in this prototype.

As for the base itself, of course, I had to create a new one for each of the joints. This was an extremely silly thing to do, but I thought each solution was the final solution. This, unfortunately, wasted a lot of time.

Finally, I have included a lid. For this, I will also add a chamfer and print at a forty-five-degree angle. This is because I need to allow for a port to be accessible through it, as well as a button and a status light.

The CAD for the base is mostly complete; I will have to come back later and fix some of the variables and names of sketches and whatnot. After I design the PCB and find the other necessary electronic parts, I will also need to edit the base to accommodate these.

Below are some screenshots of the design thus far.

## 10/20/2025 - Tidying up the CAD of the Base  

Before continuing on the path to make the CAD for the compliant quadruped, I decided to tidy up the existing design somewhat. Not all of the parameters were set correctly, so not all of the parts lined up. Additionally, I needed to ensure that the parameters allowed for an allowance between the parts.

Most of this was somewhat simple, though. I did have some trouble creating a function for the slot size of the base for the inserts, but it turned out all right! I also named all of the sketches, bodies, variables, etc., in the model to help with future editing.

Below is a view I created of the CAD model that shows the added proportionality and allowance.

## 10/24/2025 - Designing the First Leg Section of the Quadruped  

I just finished creating the first iteration of the hip-to-knee leg section in CAD. I still need to tidy up some of the variables, sketch names, etc., but it is almost complete. Below is a screenshot of the design.

![Screenshot 2025-10-24 220138](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTM1MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ec355f03b8505ae1769eafdc1f410120c9793a12/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20220138.png)

The most difficult and time-consuming part of this design was ensuring that it was 3d printable. I really want to have the design not need supports for the rolling contact joints. I mentioned this in earlier updates, but I do not believe I explained my reasoning behind this thoroughly. My main reason for not wanting support material is the uneven surfaces it will create when removing it. I need to have the contact surfaces of the rolling contact joints as smooth as possible. Additionally, it might be nearly impossible to remove the supports from some of the smaller sections, such as the holes through which the cables for the joints will go. Printing without supports will save many a headache and (probably) wasted prints.

This is why I am spending so much time right now looking for printability issues. I have considered this leg section for printability, and I came upon a solution I did not think of earlier; there only needs to be a gap for the cable on one side of the joint. This simplifies my design tremendously. This means I can print one contact surface on this leg with a slot and one without, implementing the missing slots in the last leg section. This also means that the grooves for the hip joint in the base are redundant, and I can redesign the base all over again to simplify the design.

Though this will add time to the design process, redesigning the base without the groves will allow me to implement everything into one piece without the inserts. The geometries that were impossible to print in the base were for the slots. Now that I am removing the slots from the base, I can print everything in one batteries included piece. Not only will this simplify the design, but it will also allow for more room in the base for the electronics and other hardware.

To ensure the printability for this piece, I will be printing it at a forty-five-degree angle on a chamfer. I will probably need to add some support fins on the design, but this will be minimal and easy to remove.

The next steps will include cleaning up the variable names, sketch names, and the contents of the variables to ensure the design is structured well. After this, I can redesign the base before creating the second (and last) leg segment.

## 10/28/2025 - Redesign of the Base  

I just completed the redesign of the base of the model. Below is an image of the model thus far. I now have the final design of the base and first leg section, leaving only the second leg section and the cap (the optional TPU part) for this. The design is finally starting to be put together!

![Screenshot 2025-10-28 185405](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjQwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--556203b5d446b6e43e913643b17af6e48e185242/Screenshot%202025-10-28%20185405.png)


I started this session by reorganizing the parameter names, action names, sketch names, etc., of the first leg section. I still have to double-check some aspects (one of the chamfers is not set right; I need to figure out what is wrong with the parameters I have inputted for it), but it is practically set.

I then transitioned into the base. My original plan was to have the base print flat (for strength) and have a slot that runs the depth of the wall, where the joints would be, to allow the cord (of the rolling contact joint) to go around. I realized, though, when I was almost finished, that this would be extremely weak. The joint would put pressure along the layer lines, which would probably make it break within two seconds of creating it.

This forced me to rethink the design. I restarted, and I now have something very similar to my very first try (how ironic), and I will have it print on a forty-five-degree angle with a custom support rib. With this orientation, I was thinking that I could move the grooves for the joint into the base and simplify the first joint design, but I decided not to. This is not because it is a good idea, but rather due to the time limit I have. I cannot do micro-optimization the whole time.

One noticeable difference of this new base design is that I extended the rim all the way around the base to retain the joint. This will make the printing on the chamfer much more reliable.

Finally, I redesigned the lid, once again, to accommodate the changes.

My next steps will be to tidy up the designs of the lid and base, before continuing with the legs. I am planning to finish this within the next two weeks, so I have plenty of time to choose the electronics.
